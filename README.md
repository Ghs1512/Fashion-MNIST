# Fashion-MNIST

The proposed work in this study is a deep learning model for
the classification of ten categories of fashion items. The model
attains a maximum accuracy of 0.98 with a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Inception v3 architecture. To improve model
interpretability, Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-
agnostic Explanations (LIME) are utilized. LIME heatmaps
reveal important image areas that impact the modelâ€™s predictions,
whereas SHAP summary plots indicate the most important
features that drive classification decisions.
